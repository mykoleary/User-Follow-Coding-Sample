Rails Exercise:
===============
We'd like you to create a simple Rails 3 application.
Create models that allow a user to follow another user.
The user model's only attribute is "name". You may scaffold the create action.
Create an interface that accepts post requests that allows users to
"follow" other users.

The user's "index" action should list all of the users.
The user's "show" action should show:
1) The user's name
2) The users the user is currently following (with a button to remove
that following)
3) The users the user is not following (with a button to add that following)
4)  The users currently following this user
Do not create a login system for this exercise.


THOUGHTS / EXPLANATIONS
========================
* added scope :without_user to User model to allow for removing the passed user from results for non followers query - we may want to re-use this
* no pagination was put in place due to approaching this as more of a logic exercise and less of a complete site exercise

TODO:
=====
* better security around which user scaffold actions are visible
* remove cruft added by scaffold and rails project generation that is not needed
* remove un-used icons from icon sets
